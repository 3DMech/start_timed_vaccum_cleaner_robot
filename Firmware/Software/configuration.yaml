    #RoboVac groups to start cleaning
    #Add the following groups to your "group:" in configuration.yaml!
group:

# default_view only neccessary for first tests
  default_view:
    view: yes
    icon: mdi:home
    entities:
      - group.RoboVac
 
 # This will merge all the switches into one group!
 # Important: add the control: hidden option, this will hide complete group switch
  RoboVac:
    name: RoboVac
    control: hidden
    entities:
      - switch.Button_auto
      - switch.Button_corner
      - switch.Button_max
